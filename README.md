# Interactive Solar System
This is the repository for the TESP 2018 group project named "Interactive Solar System". The idea of the project is to provide an easy learning tool for the kids who could simply project a 2D image of the solar system on a surface, on which they could control a space shuttle with an external USB camera to roam around the space and land on the celestial bodies to get information about them. 

# Requirements
The program was coded in Python 3.5. Kindly install the missing packages which will be prompted once tried. A USB camera should be plugged in order to run the program. 

# Use
Run the program (`python camera_pose.py`) and direct the external USB camera towards the surface on which the projector is projecting the 2D image, prompted by the program. The USB camera will act as a controller for the space shuttle, which should be moved gently and slowly. Abrupt movements and sudden changes in rotation may not be the most clever way to control the shuttle. As the shuttle lands on the celestial body, a small information box about the planets will pop up.

# Continous Development
Depending on availability of free time, the project can be extended by one or more members of the project. The file 'camera_pose2.py' is intended for this purpose, and thus it is not supposed to be ran for any kind of purpose unless stated.
